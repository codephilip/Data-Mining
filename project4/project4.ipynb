    "&emsp;&emsp; In this project we are investigating the correlation between various risk factors such as cholesterol, high-blood pressure, etc. and heart disease. The multivariate heart Disease Data Set we are using contains 270 instances, with 13 attributes that give us insight into the observed patients' biology and lifestyle. The Dataset is said to include Categorical values, Integer, and Real numbers. Some values are missing, so the data will need to be cleaned. \n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp; This dataset has been cited in several research papers in the data science field including: Diversity in Neural Network Ensembles (Gavin Brown. The University of Birmingham. 2004.), Overcoming the Myopia of Inductive Learning Algorithms with RELIEFF (Igor Kononenko and Edvard Simec and Marko Robnik-Sikonja), Unanimous Voting using Support Vector Machines (Elena Smirnova and Ida G. Sprinkhuizen-Kuyper and I. Nalbantis and b. ERIM and Universiteit Rotterdam, IKAT, Universiteit Maastricht), Dissertation Towards Understanding Stacking Studies of a General Ensemble Learning Scheme ausgeführt zum Zwecke der Erlangung des akademischen Grades eines Doktors der technischen Naturwissenschaften.\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp; The dataset was uploaded by the University of California, Irvine, and is available at the UCI machine learning archive on their website for the Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems at the following URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(heart)\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp; Our data set has already been processed and includes no missing values, so there is no need for a plot to summarize the proportion of missing data as this is non-applicable for all 13 attributes. The 13 attributes (which have been extracted from a larger set of 75) include descriptive variables such as sex, and Chest pain type (4 values), however, these values were already label encoded. As such, we are left with the following attribute types: Real: 1,4,5,8,10,12 Ordered:11,Binary: 2,6,9 Nominal:7,3,13\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp; Given that the categorical values were already label encoded, the choice (label-encoded vs one hot-encoded) was made for us and we assume that the alphabetical ordering of label encoding will not prevent us from making medically relevant inferences from this data. In other words, we assume that the categorical value was ordered alphabetically as to represent the severity of the pain, for example, A-D. This assumption may give us trouble down the road, and should be further investigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp; If we were to work with categorical values for chest pain, one might suggest one-hot encoding to prevent any issues that may arise if there is no obvious ordering, or ranking of our values, and rather solve this potential problem by representing each category as a binary vector. However, in order to avoid the pitfalls of multicollinearity, it would be best to simply determine that categorical data is ranked appropriately and use label-encoding instead. Sex/Gender is binary, and so labelencoding can be considered appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp; We will be using k-means clustering to help identify variables that are most correlated to heart disease, and use dimensionality reduction across all attributes to determine the correlation between respective attributes and k-means.These techniques belong to the class of unsupervised learning and represent highly relevant skills in the toolbelt of every data miner, allowing us to demonstrate our progress throughout the course. At this point we are more concerned with descriptive analysis using the tools that we learned in data mining.    \n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to continue our research into this data set we might concern ourselves with more predictive analysis using tools like classification and regression models.\n"
